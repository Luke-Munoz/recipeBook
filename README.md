The technology we used was a mongoose database and a restful api for th backend. the specific technologies that were used were Node.js, React, Javascript, HTML, and Insomnia to test the routes once the routes were completed.

## Contributors
Luke and I were given the responsibility of getting the backend up and running which meant we had to do all of the routes that would get the data we needed. Trevon was a master at designing the front end of our application. He has amazing designing skills and is really good at making things appear very nice and orderly. Jacek was our person that connected the front end with the back end as our full stack developer. He has done amazing work on this project. Throughout we were able to come together and work through the majority of our errors.
