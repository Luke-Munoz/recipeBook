# recipeBook
A place where users can post recipes and share them with the world!


## Application Description:
This applicaiton is basically a food blog where people can post and share food recipes with their friends. Luke, Trevon, and Jacek came up with this idea for our application after discussing how they do not like forgetting recipes to dishes they really enjoyed. I joined the group after they had finalized this idea for the applicaiton. Users can use this application to interact with each other by leaving comments on recipes they tried for themsleves. In conclusion, the problem that this application solves is allowing users to have an online cookbook where they can store recpies they really liked without forgetting them later on.

## Application Organization:
Luke and I were given the task of getting the database and the routes working for the application. We split the responsibility of creating the tables for the database between us initally with me creating the User model and Luke creating the Recipes/Comments models. After we were both done with the models we both took on different assignments in creating the other parts of our database. Luke took on the responsiblity of using axios base code to upload pictures of the recipies to one of the pages we created for the blog. I took on the responsiblity to get our database seeded along with creating a mongoose based session so the application could tell when a user logged in. Throughtout the whole process we consistently communicated with each other if we ever needed to ask each other questions about errors that we needed to solve.

Jacek and Trevon took on the tasks associated with organinzing the front end part of our food blog. Trevon was the one who was in charge of using CSS elements along with the react app stylesheet to design our food blog. Trevon was also in charge of making our food blog look good on multiple devices such as ipads and tablets. Jacek had the responsibility of adding functionality to our food blog. The functionality Jacek added to our food blog was giving the user the ability to post recipes, leave comments on other recipies, and login onto our food blog.

The main element that helped us the most in getting our food blog organized by the deadline was all of us communicating with each other if we ever need help in getting errors with the food blog fixed.

As mentioned in the descirpiton the usage of this app is ment to be a place where people can post any recpie of their choice and share it with the world. We alos hope that those who reply to the recipes on our applicaiton do so in a manner that is professional and polite. Ultimately we hope our website is used for good and that people can share their love of food.

## Technology
The technology we used was a mongoose database and a restful api for th backend. the specific technologies that were used were Node.js, React, Javascript, HTML, and Insomnia to test the routes once the routes were completed.

## Contributors
Luke and I were given the responsibility of getting the backend up and running which meant we had to do all of the routes that would get the data we needed. Trevon was a master at designing the front end of our application. He has amazing designing skills and is really good at making things appear very nice and orderly. Jacek was our person that connected the front end with the back end as our full stack developer. He has done amazing work on this project. Throughout we were able to come together and work through the majority of our errors.
